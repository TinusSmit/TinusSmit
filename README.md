- 👋 Hi, I’m @TinusSmit, a software developer by trade.
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, coding, sci-fi media, and all sorts of tech I'm still discovering. Also, I like making a difference 😁
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about C#, Azure, SQL, ~Dynamics 365~ ~Common Data Service~ Microsoft Dataverse, and the Power Platform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something small initially, I'm rather new to the collaboration scene outside of my work 😅
- 📫 How to reach me: [@AgentTinus](https://twitter.com/AgentTinus), I'll probably link a Discord profile here later.
